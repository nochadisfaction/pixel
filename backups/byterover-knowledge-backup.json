After check-in, progress should be logged into OpenMemory MCP for knowledge retention, ensuring all updates and decisions are traceable and preserved within the workspace. All actions and changes are logged with OpenMemory, ensuring traceability within the memory workspace. Context: Diligent logging ensures up-to-date audit trails, reducing compliance risks.",

Context: Visual aids like these streamline concept communication and support long-term content reuse in diverse scenarios. The 4-phase learning journey is visually highlighted on the home page with the '/images/explainers/4-learning-journey.svg' asset, replacing previously generic imagery to more accurately represent the educational progression central to the product's mental health training focus. Recently, new SVG explainer graphics have been officially adopted in documentation and READMEs to ensure high-quality, context-specific, and reliable visuals for core concepts, such as the main logo (now '/public/cube.svg') and value demonstration ('/public/images/explainers/1-traditional-vs-ai-training.svg').
