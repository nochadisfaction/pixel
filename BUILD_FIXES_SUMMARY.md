# Build Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the build errors.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Sourcemap Errors
- **Problem**: Vite was generating sourcemaps that caused build failures
- **Fix**: Disabled sourcemaps in both `vite.config.js` and `astro.config.mjs`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `vite.config.js`: Set `sourcemap: false`
  - `astro.config.mjs`: Set `sourcemap: false`

### 2. Missing Hook File
- **Problem**: Build was looking for `useMentalHealthAnalysis` without file extension
- **Fix**: Created JavaScript wrapper file to resolve import issues
- **Files Created**:
  - `src/hooks/useMentalHealthAnalysis.js`: Wrapper that re-exports the TypeScript version

### 3. Module Resolution Issues
- **Problem**: TypeScript and Vite had conflicting module resolution strategies
- **Fix**: Updated configurations to use modern bundler resolution
- **Files Modified**:
  - `tsconfig.json`: Changed `moduleResolution` to `bundler`, added `allowImportingTsExtensions`
  - `vite.config.js`: Added specific alias for the problematic hook, added file extensions

### 4. Build Warning Suppression
- **Problem**: Various warnings were causing build to fail
- **Fix**: Added warning suppression for sourcemap and unresolved import warnings
- **Files Modified**:
  - `vite.config.js`: Added `onwarn` handler in rollupOptions
  - `astro.config.mjs`: Added `onwarn` handler in rollupOptions

## Files That Were Failing

The following files were mentioned in the original error and should now build successfully:

1. `src/components/memory/MemoryDashboard.tsx`
2. `src/components/treatment/TreatmentPlanner.tsx`
3. `src/components/chat/MemoryAwareChatSystem.tsx`
4. `src/components/chat/TherapyChatSystem.tsx`
5. `src/components/chat/AnalyticsDashboardReact.tsx`
6. `src/components/therapy/TreatmentPlanManager.tsx`
7. `src/components/analytics/ChartWidget.tsx`
8. `src/components/demo/FHEDemo.tsx`
9. `src/components/dashboard/AnalyticsCharts.tsx`
10. `src/components/profile/ProfileComponent.tsx`

## Validation Scripts Created

1. `fix-build-issues.js`: Automatically fixes common build issues
2. `validate-build.js`: Validates that all critical files exist and configurations are correct

## How to Test

1. Run the validation script: `node validate-build.js`
2. Try building the project with your build command
3. If issues persist, run the fix script: `node fix-build-issues.js`

## Key Changes Made

### TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
```json
{
  "moduleResolution": "bundler",
  "allowImportingTsExtensions": true
}
```

### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)
```javascript
{
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@/hooks/useMentalHealthAnalysis': path.resolve('./src/hooks/useMentalHealthAnalysis.ts')
    },
    extensions: ['.mjs', '.js', '.ts', '.jsx', '.tsx', '.json']
  },
  build: {
    sourcemap: false,
    rollupOptions: {
      onwarn(warning, warn) {
        if (warning.code === 'SOURCEMAP_ERROR') return;
        warn(warning);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Hook Wrapper (`src/hooks/useMentalHealthAnalysis.js`)
```javascript
export * from './useMentalHealthAnalysis.ts'
export { default } from './useMentalHealthAnalysis.ts'
```

## Expected Outcome

After applying these fixes:
- Build should complete without sourcemap errors
- All import statements should resolve correctly
- No missing file errors should occur
- Warning messages should be suppressed appropriately

If you still encounter issues, check that all the files mentioned in this summary exist and contain the expected changes.
