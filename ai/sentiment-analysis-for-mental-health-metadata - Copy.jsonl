The dataset amalgamates raw data from multiple sources, cleaned and compiled to create a robust resource for developing chatbots and performing sentiment analysis. \n\n###**Data Source**:\n\nThe dataset integrates information from the following Kaggle datasets:\n\n- [3k Conversations Dataset for Chatbot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kreeshrajani/3k-conversations-dataset-for-chatbot)\n- [Depression Reddit Cleaned](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infamouscoder/depression-reddit-cleaned)\n- [Human Stress Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kreeshrajani/human-stress-prediction)\n- [Predicting Anxiety in Mental Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michellevp/predicting-anxiety-in-mental-health-data)\n- [Mental Health Dataset Bipolar](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michellevp/mental-health-dataset-bipolar)\n- [Reddit Mental Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelghoshal/reddit-mental-health-data)\n- [Students Anxiety and Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahasourav17/students-anxiety-and-depression-dataset)\n- [Suicidal Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aradhakkandhari/suicidal-mental-health-dataset)\n- [Suicidal Tweet Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aunanya875/suicidal-tweet-detection-dataset)\n\n### **Data Overview**:\n\nThe dataset consists of statements tagged with one of the following seven mental health statuses:\n- **Normal**\n- **Depression**\n- **Suicidal**\n- **Anxiety**\n- **Stress**\n- **Bi-Polar**\n- **Personality Disorder**\n\n#### Data Collection:\n\nThe data is sourced from diverse platforms including social media posts, Reddit posts, Twitter posts, and more. Each entry is tagged with a specific mental health status, making it an invaluable asset for:\n\n- Developing intelligent mental health chatbots.\n- Performing in-depth sentiment analysis.\n- Research and studies related to mental health trends.\n\n#### Features:\n- **unique_id**: A unique identifier for each entry.\n- **Statement**: The textual data or post.\n- **Mental Health Status**: The tagged mental health status of the statement.\n\n#### Usage:\n\nThis dataset is ideal for training machine learning models aimed at understanding and predicting mental health conditions based on textual data. It can be used in various applications such as:\n\n- Chatbot development for mental health support.\n- Sentiment analysis to gauge mental health trends.\n- Academic research on mental health patterns.\n\n#### Acknowledgments:\n\nThis dataset was created by aggregating and cleaning data from various publicly available datasets on Kaggle. Special thanks to the original dataset creators for their contributions."}
