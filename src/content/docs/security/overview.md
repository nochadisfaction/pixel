- Perfect forward secrecy
- Strong cipher suites
- Certificate pinning
- HSTS implementation

## Compliance Framework

    - Business Associate Agreements - Privacy Rule compliance - Security Rule
    implementation - Breach notification procedures
    - SOC 2 Type II certified - NIST Cybersecurity Framework - ISO 27001
    compliance - GDPR compliance
    - Regular risk assessments - Incident response plans - Business continuity -
    Disaster recovery

## Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring

```bash Alert Example
{
  "alert_type": "security_event",
  "severity": "high",
  "description": "Multiple failed login attempts detected",
  "source_ip": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-21T10:30:00Z"
}
```

```bash Response Action
{
  "action": "account_lockout",
  "duration": "1h",
  "reason": "excessive_login_attempts",
  "account_id": "user_123"
}
```


### Audit Logging

- Comprehensive event logging
- Tamper-evident logs
- Real-time alerting
- Log retention policies
- Automated analysis
