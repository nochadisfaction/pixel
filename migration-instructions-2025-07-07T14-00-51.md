# Manual Migration Instructions: ByteRover to OpenMemory

Since this script runs outside of the MCP environment, here are the manual steps
you can follow to migrate your data:

## Step 1: Extract ByteRover Data

Run this in your VS Code environment where MCP tools are available:

```
Call the tool: mcp_byterover-mcp_byterover-retrive-knowledge
Parameters: 
{
  "query": "all stored knowledge data memories conversations insights",
  "limit": 1000
}
```

## Step 2: Review the Retrieved Data

You should see approximately 44+ memories based on the sample we retrieved earlier.
Key categories include:

- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Engineering**: Database schemas, bias detection, clinical knowledge
- üîß **Development Workflows**: Logging, validation, testing, CI/CD processes  
- üß† **AI & ML**: Model configurations, training pipelines, evidence extraction
- üìä **Analytics & Monitoring**: Performance metrics, dashboards, real-time analytics
- üîí **Security & Compliance**: HIPAA compliance, audit trails, encryption
- üé® **Content & UX**: SVG visualizations, documentation, marketing assets

## Step 3: Migrate to OpenMemory

For each memory retrieved from ByteRover, call:

```
Tool: mcp_openmemory_add-memory
Parameters:
{
  "content": "[paste the content from ByteRover memory here]"
}
```

## Step 4: Verify Migration

After migrating all memories, verify with:

```
Tool: mcp_openmemory_list-memories
```

## Step 5: Test Memory Functionality

Test that the migrated memories work by searching:

```
Tool: mcp_openmemory_search-memories
Parameters:
{
  "query": "bias detection"
}
```

## Key Memories to Prioritize

Based on our analysis, these are the most critical memories to migrate first:

1. **Bias Detection Engine**: Database schema and implementation details
2. **Clinical Knowledge Base**: Medical guidelines and therapeutic workflows
3. **Task Management**: Ollama check-in protocols and task completion workflows
4. **Security Implementations**: HIPAA compliance and audit logging
5. **AI Model Configurations**: Performance metrics and specialized use cases

## Alternative: Automated Migration Script

If you want to automate this process, you can:

1. Copy the memory contents to a JSON file
2. Use a script that reads the JSON and calls the OpenMemory tools
3. Run batch operations with error handling

Would you like me to create a batch migration file with the actual memory contents?
