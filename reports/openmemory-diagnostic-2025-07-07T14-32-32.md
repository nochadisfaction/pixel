# OpenMemory MCP Diagnostic Report

**Generated**: 2025-07-07T14:32:32.294Z  
**Issue**: OpenMemory accepts memories but doesn't persist or retrieve them

## Configuration Analysis

The OpenMemory MCP is configured in `.cursor/mcp.json` with:
- Command: `npx -y openmemory`
- API Key: Present (om-8u4kp...)
- Client: cursor

## Diagnostic Results

### Symptoms Observed
- ✅ `mcp_openmemory_add-memory` returns "Memory added successfully"  
- ❌ `mcp_openmemory_list-memories` returns "No memories found"
- ❌ `mcp_openmemory_search-memories` returns "No memories found"

### Possible Root Causes

1. **Session/Context Issues**: Memories might be stored in a session context that doesn't persist
2. **API Key Issues**: The API key might be invalid or have limited permissions
3. **Service Configuration**: OpenMemory server might not be configured to persist data
4. **Storage Backend**: Database or file system issues preventing persistence
5. **Client/Server Mismatch**: Version compatibility issues between client and server

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Restart Development Environment**: Close and reopen VS Code/Cursor to reload MCP configuration
2. **Verify API Key**: Check if the OpenMemory API key is valid and active
3. **Check Service Status**: Ensure OpenMemory service is running and accessible

#### Alternative Solutions
1. **✅ COMPLETED - Migration to mem0ai**: Successfully migrated all knowledge to mem0ai which provides reliable persistence and excellent search capabilities
2. **Use Local Memory API**: Implement local file-based memory storage
3. **Try Alternative MCP**: Consider other memory MCP servers

#### Long-term Fixes
1. **Contact OpenMemory Support**: Report the persistence issue to OpenMemory developers
2. **Alternative Option - Hybrid System**: Use both OpenMemory/mem0ai and local storage for redundancy
3. **Build Custom Memory Bridge**: Create a service that syncs between systems

## Files for Investigation

- `.cursor/mcp.json` - MCP configuration
- `src/lib/memory/memory-client.ts` - Local memory client
- `logs/openmemory-diagnostic-*.log` - Diagnostic logs

## Next Steps

1. Run this diagnostic again after restarting VS Code
2. Try adding a memory with different content to test persistence
3. Check OpenMemory documentation for known issues
4. Consider implementing fallback to local memory system
