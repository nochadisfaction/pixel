- **AWESOME** Implement iterative process of benchmarking and optimization as cornerstone of high-performing software development

## Bias Detection Engine Implementation Continuation - Analysis and Planning

### Ollama Overlord Suggestions:
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate the nature of the test failures. Identify patterns in failed tests to understand if they are due to biased data, flawed model architecture, or improper evaluation criteria.
- **Data Audit**: Review the training datasets for potential biases. This may involve examining demographic distributions, content analysis, and assessing data collection methods.
- **Model Evaluation Refinement**: Modify the evaluation metrics to better capture bias-related performance indicators. Consider incorporating fairness metrics such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, or equalized odds.
- **Algorithm Tuning**: Fine-tune the machine learning algorithms to minimize bias. Techniques like adversarial debiasing or reweighing can be employed to mitigate biases during training.
- **Iterate Testing and Analysis**: Implement changes based on findings, then retest using a comprehensive suite of tests covering various aspects of fairness, robustness, and accuracy.
- **AWESOME** Documentation and Reporting: Document all findings, modifications, and evaluation results. This transparency is crucial for accountability and continuous improvement in AI development processes.
- **AWESOME** Stakeholder Communication: Keep relevant stakeholders (e.g., team members, management) informed about the progress, challenges, and solutions implemented to address bias in the system.

## Data Structure Mapping Fix for Layer Analysis Methods

### Ollama Overlord Latest Suggestions:
- **Refine Data Mapping**: Adjust the TypeScript layer analysis methods to align with the Python service's data structure. This may involve creating additional transformation or mapping functions between the two systems.
- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests specifically targeting these 4 layers and the new/adjusted mappings. Ensure that each method performs as expected after modifications.
- **Integration Testing**: Once unit testing is complete, integrate these methods into the larger system to test end-to-end functionality. This will validate if the data mapping has resolved all test failures and if there are no regressions introduced by these changes.
- **Code Review**: Submit your updated code for review. This step ensures that your solution aligns with best practices, maintains system consistency, and can be understood by other developers in the team.
- **Documentation**: Document the changes made to data mapping procedures and updated test cases for future reference.

**Status**: Root cause identified - TypeScript layer analysis methods expect different data structure properties (biasScore, fairnessMetrics, counterfactualAnalysis, nlpBiasMetrics) than what Python service returns (bias_score, metrics.{}, etc.). 

**Next Steps**: Fix the 4 layer analysis methods (`runPreprocessingAnalysis`, `runModelLevelAnalysis`, `runInteractiveAnalysis`, `runEvaluationAnalysis`) to properly map Python service response structure to expected TypeScript interface.
