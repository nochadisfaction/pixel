# PRD: Bias Detection Demo Enhancements

## Product Overview

Enhance the existing bias detection demo with advanced features including preset scenarios, export functionality, counterfactual analysis, and historical comparison to provide a more comprehensive and professional demonstration of our AI bias detection capabilities.

## Problem Statement

The current bias detection demo, while functional, lacks several key features that would make it more compelling for stakeholders and potential clients:
- No quick way to test different bias scenarios
- No ability to export analysis results
- Missing counterfactual analysis visualization
- No historical context or trend comparison
- Limited preset examples for demonstration

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in demo session duration
- **Feature Adoption**: 70% of users try preset scenarios
- **Export Usage**: 30% of completed analyses are exported
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: 90% positive feedback on enhanced features
- **Demo Effectiveness**: 50% increase in follow-up inquiries

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Sales Teams, Product Managers, Potential Clients

**As a sales representative**, I want preset bias scenarios so I can quickly demonstrate different bias detection capabilities without manually creating test cases.

**As a product manager**, I want to export analysis results so I can share detailed findings with stakeholders and include them in presentations.

**As a potential client**, I want to see counterfactual analysis so I can understand how different scenarios would affect bias detection outcomes.

**As a technical evaluator**, I want historical comparison data so I can assess the system's performance trends and reliability.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Preset Scenario System
- **Quick Test Buttons**: 4 preset scenarios (High Bias, Low Bias, Cultural, Gender)
- **Realistic Content**: Each preset includes appropriate demographics and session content
- **One-Click Loading**: Instantly populate all form fields with preset data
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded buttons showing bias risk level

### 2. Export Functionality
- **JSON Export**: Download complete analysis results in structured format
- **Metadata Inclusion**: Timestamp, session ID, version info
- **Automatic Naming**: Files named with session ID for easy identification
- **Export Button**: Only visible after successful analysis completion

### 3. Counterfactual Analysis Display
- **Scenario Variations**: Show 3 different counterfactual scenarios
- **Impact Predictions**: Quantified bias score changes for each variation
- **Likelihood Indicators**: Visual confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)
- **Interactive Presentation**: Clean, organized display with color coding

### 4. Historical Comparison
- **30-Day Average**: Simulated historical bias score baseline
- **Trend Indicators**: Visual arrows showing improvement/decline
- **Percentage Comparison**: Current analysis vs historical average
- **Status Display**: Overall trend direction (Improving/Stable/Declining)

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Enhancements
- **TypeScript Integration**: Maintain type safety for new features
- **Event Handling**: Robust click handlers for all new interactive elements
- **State Management**: Track analysis results for export functionality
- **UI Responsiveness**: Ensure new elements work across device sizes

### Data Management
- **Result Storage**: Temporarily store analysis results in memory
