## 🚀 Active Implementation Tasks

### NEW: 0. Implement Production-Grade Crisis Protocol [🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY]
- [x] Define `NotificationService` interface for crisis alerts. (Renamed to `ICrisisNotificationHandler`, implemented 2025-05-17)
- [x] Modify `MentalLLaMAAdapter` to accept and use an optional `NotificationService`. (Used `ICrisisNotificationHandler`, implemented 2025-05-17)

  - [x] Ensure `analyzeMentalHealth` return value clearly and unambiguously flags the crisis state and provides necessary details. (Implemented in `MentalLLaMAAdapter`, returns `mentalHealthCategory: 'crisis'`)
- [ ] Consider mechanisms for session/user flagging for immediate review (e.g., update user status via an API if available). (Marked with detailed TODO in `MentalLLaMAAdapter`; requires external service integration)
- [x] Document the crisis protocol flow and requirements for upstream service integration. (JSDoc in `MentalLLaMAAdapter` and `ICrisisNotificationHandler` interface serve as initial documentation. Further high-level docs can be added.)
- [x] Implement `SlackNotificationService` as an `ICrisisNotificationHandler`:
  - [x] Create `src/lib/services/notification/SlackNotificationService.ts`. (Verified existing, is robust)
  - [x] Constructor to accept Slack webhook URL (from config, e.g., `config.notifications.slackWebhookUrl()`). (Verified)

### 6. Performance Optimization [MEDIUM PRIORITY]

#### API Response Time Reduction (Target: 850ms -> 300ms)
- [ ] Profile current API endpoints to identify bottlenecks (e.g., model inference, data pre/post-processing, network latency). (Needs to be done for new system)
  - [ ] Added detailed timing logs to `analyze.ts`. (Old `analyze.ts` does not exist; new components have basic logging)
  - [ ] Implemented caching for `MentalLLaMAFactory.createFromEnv()` in `analyze.ts`. (N/A for current factory structure)
- [ ] Investigate model optimization techniques (e.g., quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation if applicable). (TBD for actual models)
  - [-] Reviewed `MentalLLaMAModelProvider.ts`: Logged specialized endpoint calls and fallbacks. (New provider has basic logging; detailed review for optimization TBD)
- [-] Optimize PythonBridge communication if it's a bottleneck. (Bridge is a stub; optimization TODO added for future real implementation)
  - [ ] Investigated `MentalLLaMAPythonBridge.ts`: Key latency points would be initial `initialize()` completion, per-call Python process spawning, script execution time (model loading within script), and data I/O. Optimization would be needed if logs show this bridge is a frequent or slow path for `analyzeText`. (Relevant for future real bridge)
- [ ] Evaluate and implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data or model responses where appropriate. (TODO added in `MentalLLaMAAdapter.ts`)
- [ ] Explore batching requests if applicable for the model. (TODO added in `MentalLLaMAAdapter.ts`)
- [ ] Review and optimize data pre-processing and post-processing steps. (TODOs added in `MentalLLaMAModelProvider.ts`)
- [ ] Assess infrastructure for potential upgrades or optimizations (e.g., faster compute, network configuration). (This is an ongoing infrastructure concern. As specific bottlenecks are identified with real models, targeted upgrades or configuration changes will be evaluated.)
- [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for long-running sub-tasks if they block the main response. (TODO added in `MentalLLaMAModelProvider.ts` regarding async API calls)

## Prompt Engineering (Structure Implemented, Content & Tools In Progress)

The prompt engineering phase has seen the implementation of core template structures:

1. **Advanced Prompt Templates**

   - Created specialized templates for depression, anxiety, stress, suicidal ideation, and PTSD detection
   - Implemented templates for different clinical contexts (intake, crisis, therapy, monitoring, assessment)
   - Developed a system for template refinement based on evaluation results

2. **Comprehensive Test Datasets**

   - Built extensive test datasets for each mental health category
   - Included diverse indicators, severity levels, and edge cases
   - Created both positive and negative examples for better discrimination

3. **Prompt Evaluation System**

   - Implemented metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confidence
   - Built batch evaluation capabilities for comparing template performance
   - Created visualization tools for results analysis

4. **Optimization Framework**

   - Developed a systematic approach to prompt refinement
   - Implemented multiple refinement techniques for iterative improvement
   - Created tools for comparative analysis of refinement strategies

5. **CLI Tools for Testing and Evaluation**
   - Created a clinical scenario testing tool (`test-clinical-scenarios.ts`)
   - Built a batch evaluation system (`batch-evaluate.ts`)
   - Implemented tools for recommending optimal templates

### Key Files

- `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/prompts/prompt-templates.ts`: Contains core prompt generation functions and placeholder structures for the 5-Tier framework and specialized prompts.
- `src/scripts/mental-llama-analyze.ts`: CLI tool that utilizes the MentalLLaMAFactory and adapter for analysis (useful for basic prompt testing).
- Additional files for refiners, comprehensive datasets, and specialized CLI tools are TBD.

## Evaluation System (Initial Stubs, Needs Full Implementation & Review)

The evaluation system's integration with the new MentalLLaMA components needs to be developed:

1. **BART-Score Implementation** (Existing code needs integration with new Adapter)

   - `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/utils/bart-score.ts` (Assumed existing per original doc, needs verification and integration into new adapter)
   - Evaluation modes and metrics need to be wired into `MentalLLaMAAdapter.evaluateExplanationQuality`.

2. **Clinical Relevance Scoring** (Existing code needs integration with new Adapter)

   - `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/utils/clinical-relevance.ts` (Assumed existing per original doc, needs verification and integration into new adapter)
   - Metrics need to be wired into `MentalLLaMAAdapter.evaluateExplanationQuality`.

3. **User Feedback System** (Existing code needs integration review)

   - `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/feedback.ts` (Assumed existing per original doc, needs review for how it connects to new analysis flow and adapter)

4. **MentalLLaMA Adapter - Evaluation Aspect**
   - `MentalLLaMAAdapter.evaluateExplanationQuality` is currently a stub.
   - It needs to be implemented to utilize any existing or new BART-score, clinical relevance, and other metric calculation tools/services.
   - Fallbacks, debugging, and logging for evaluation are part of this future implementation.

### Next Steps (Revised 2024-03-15)

1.  **Direct Model Integration**: Connect `MentalLLaMAModelProvider` to actual LLM API endpoints (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Together AI, or custom) by implementing the actual `fetch` calls and response parsing. Update mock calls to be true fallbacks or test modes.
2.  **Python Bridge Implementation (If Required)**: If Python-specific models or logic are essential, develop the Python-side script for `MentalLLaMAPythonBridge.ts` and implement the actual inter-process communication.
3.  **Prompt Content Development**: Flesh out the 5-Tier framework content (specifics, context, few-shot examples, emotional enhancements, strategic reminders) and detailed specialized prompts in `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/prompts/prompt-templates.ts`.
4.  **Contextual Router Rules**: Implement meaningful logic within `MentalHealthTaskRouter.applyContextualRules` based on `RoutingContext`.
5.  **Evaluation System Implementation**: Implement `MentalLLaMAAdapter.evaluateExplanationQuality` by integrating with tools like `bart-score.ts` and `clinical-relevance.ts` (verifying their existence and functionality first).
6.  **Configuration Refinement**: Ensure all necessary API keys, endpoints, and parameters are robustly handled through `env.config.ts` and utilized correctly by the factory and components.
7.  **Comprehensive Testing**:
    *   Write unit tests for individual components (Router, Provider, Adapter methods).
    *   Write integration tests for the flow from Adapter to Provider (with mocked LLM endpoints initially, then real ones).
    *   Utilize and expand `mental-llama-analyze.ts` for end-to-end functional testing.
8.  **Performance Optimization**: Begin addressing TODOs for caching, batching, pre/post-processing optimizations once real models are integrated and bottlenecks can be identified.
9.  **Security & Compliance Review**: Conduct a security review of the new components, focusing on data handling, API interactions, and logging.
10. **Documentation Update**: Update any external documentation (e.g., in `src/content/docs/`) to reflect the new MentalLLaMA system architecture and usage.
